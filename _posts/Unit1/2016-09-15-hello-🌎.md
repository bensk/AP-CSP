Try dragging the **Learning Target**.

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-preview-width="700">
var aim = "ðŸŽ¯ Learning Target: I can create a simple p5 sketch.";
var do_now = "Do Now: How many programming languages have you learned? Which is your favorite, and why?"

function setup() {
	createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);

}

function draw() {
	background('white');
	textSize(48);
	textFont("Proxima Nova");
	textStyle('bold');
	fill(`#7f1ae5`);
	if (mouseIsPressed) {
		text(aim, mouseX, mouseY, windowWidth);
		var do_now = "Uh oh...where'd the Do Now go?"
		textAlign('center')

	} else {
		text(aim, 10, 50, windowWidth);
		var do_now = "Do Now: How many programming languages have you learned? Which is your favorite, and why?"
	}
	textSize(18)
	textStyle('bold')
	fill('#424242')
	text(do_now, 10, 150, windowWidth, windowHeight)
}



function windowResized() {
	resizeCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

This is **<span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>**. It allows you to create interactive "sketches" using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.


> <small>p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for todayâ€™s web. Using the original metaphor of a software sketchbook, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, youâ€™re not limited to your drawing canvas, you can think of your whole browser page as your sketch! For this, p5.js has addon libraries that make it easy to interact with other HTML5 objects, including text, input, video, webcam, and sound.</small>


**<span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>** works on a `canvas`.

![](http://storage.googleapis.com/wzukusers/user-13385976/images/55bd59e37d7aaQu1bsn7/easel_400.png)

Everything you "draw" will be drawn on this canvas, `pixels` on a screen.

Here's one for you to play with:

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-preview-width="200">
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200,200);
}

function draw() {
  rect(50,50,80,50);
}

// What's this!?
</script>

## IDE
We're going to use an online IDE (Integrated Development Environment). We used **PyCharm** for **Python**, and we will use **[p5 Web Editor](https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/)** for, well...**<span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>**.

## Fun With Shapes

Today, we're going to learn how to draw three shapes: `line`s, `rect`angles, and `ellipse`s.

(Also, `point`, but that one's kind boring.

<span class="mega-octicon octicon-bug"></span> Go ahead and try it. Turn on a single pixel:

```javascript
point(42,42)
```

### | `line()`
A line is defined by **two points**:  A and B
In <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>:  `line(x1, y1, x2, y2);`

âœ± lower case â€˜lineâ€™    
âœ± four **parameters** in parenthesis, separated by commas    
âœ± lines end with semicolon `;`, just like JavaScript.    

<span class="mega-octicon octicon-bug"></span> Try to draw a line at an angle that _isn't_ 90Â° or 180Â° (not vertical or horizontal).

### â–­ `rect()`
In <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>, rectangles are defined by the **top left corner**, followed by a **width** and a **height**.

```javascript
rect(x, y, width, height);
```

âœ± lower case â€˜rectâ€™    
âœ± four â€˜parametersâ€™ in parenthesis    
âœ± lines end with semicolon `;`, just like JavaScript.    

You can also define them using **corners**: the _top left_ and _bottom right_ point.

```javascript
rectMode(CORNERS);
// What happens if you put rectMode(CORNERS) on line 2?
rect(x1, y1, x2, y2);
Two lines of code
```

### â¬­ `ellipse()`
An **ellipse** is an oval. For the purposes of this class (before you've studied [conic sections][c37a8208]), all we need to know is that a circle is actually a special kind of ellipse, and `ellipse()` is the command that will let us draw **round** shapes.

  [c37a8208]: https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=conic%20sections "Google it!"

In <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>, ellipses are defined by a **center** coordinate, a **width**, a **height**.

```javascript
ellipse(x, y, width, height)
```

<span class="mega-octicon octicon-bug"></span> Use this to make a circle. In a comment (`//`), what do you notice about the `width` and `height` that make a circle?

## Drawing time!

What if I combine `line`s, `rect`angles, and `ellipse`s? What can I make?

<script type="text/p5" data-preview-width="200" data-preview-height="200">
function setup() {
	createCanvas(200, 200)
}

function draw() {
	line(78, 5, 78, 200)
	line(82, 5, 82, 200)
	rect(5, 5, 150, 75);
	rect(50, 40, 60, 30);
	ellipse(80, 80, 30, 15);
}
</script>

OK, I'm not a great artist. But we're getting somewhere.

Go draw something better!

## Exit Slip!

1. What happens if you change the numbers on line 6: `rect(50,50,80,50);`?
2. How could you draw a square?
3. What is the **algorithm** that p5 uses to draw rectangles?
3. How do you write a comment in <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>?
