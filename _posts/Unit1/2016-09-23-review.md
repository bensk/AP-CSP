## Do Now
You know how to create a circle (`ellipse()`), and you know how to create a rectangle (`rect()`). How could you combine these two shapes to draw a **semicircle**?

Like this:

## Design your own character

Using the <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span> graph paper, design your own characterâ€“ either an alien ðŸ‘½/ðŸ‘¾ or a robot ðŸ¤–.

## <span class="mega-octicon octicon-check"></span> Meeting Standards
1. Planning graph paper indicates accurate pixel measurements.

2. Code corresponds to planning graph paper.

3. Code each of the following commands:

âœ± `rect()`    
âœ± `line()`    
âœ± `ellipse()`    
âœ± `fill()`    
âœ± `stroke()`    
âœ± `strokeWeight()`    

## <span class="mega-octicon octicon-rocket"></span> Push yourself for a 4!
Display the `mouseX` and `mouseY` on the screen while drawing:

```javascript
// This goes at the top of your code
background('white')
textSize(10)
text('Mouse X = ' + mouseX + " | Mouse Y = " + mouseY, 10, 10)
```
