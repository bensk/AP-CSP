## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Targets
`AP` I can analyze how data representation, storage, security, and transmission of data involve computational manipulation of information.

`AP` I can use computers to process information, find patterns, and test hypotheses about digitally processed information to gain insight and knowledge.

I can develop a strategy (heuristic algorithm) for compressing text.

## Do now

> SMH. LOL.

Why do we use abbreviations in texts?

## ðŸ—œText Compression

We "compress" txt 2 save time. Computers do it too, to save **time** and **space**.

Compression: represent data with fewer bits. Why might that be useful? Think about the [Bytes & File Sizes](http://bsk.education/AP-CSP/unit%204%20%E2%80%93%20representation/2017/02/03/bytes-file-sizes.html) research that you did.

**Original text size:** 172 bytes    
**Compressed text size:** 111 bytes

So we saved 61 bytes, right?    

**WRONG**

We also need to let our recipient _decode_ our message.

**Dictionary size:** 34 bytes   
**Total:** 145 bytes    
**Compression:**  27 bytes, or 15.75% !!

## ðŸ—œ txt cmprssn

Choose a text from English class and try to `compress` it.

Your goal is to get the **highest** compression rate. Keep note of your strategy.

What's the best compression _scheme_?

## Heuristic

>  a problem solving approach (algorithm) to find a satisfactory solution where finding an optimal or exact solution is impractical or impossible.

What kind of scenarios is our heuristic good for?

You could very easily create a "compressed" file that's **BIGGER** than the original!

## Questions
- What did all groupsâ€™ processes for compression have in common?
- Will following this process always lead to the same compression?
- If you send the compressed poem, would your friend will be able to read it? Why is the dictionary important?
- Why do you want to compress anything? Whatâ€™s the point?

**Case Study**

A simple message has been compressed below:

![](https://code.org/curriculum/docs/csp/U1L13-compressed-message.png)

What was the original message?

What was the compression rate?
