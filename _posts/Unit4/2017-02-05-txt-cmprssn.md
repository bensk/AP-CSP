## 🎯 Learning Targets
`AP` I can analyze how data representation, storage, security, and transmission of data involve computational manipulation of information.

`AP` I can use computers to process information, find patterns, and test hypotheses about digitally processed information to gain insight and knowledge.

I can develop a strategy (heuristic algorithm) for compressing text.

## Do now

> SMH. LOL.

Why do we use abbreviations in texts?

## 🗜 Compression

We "compress" txt 2 save time. Computers do it too, to save **time** and **space**.

Compression: represent data with fewer bits. Why might that be useful? Think about the [Bytes & File Sizes](http://bsk.education/AP-CSP/unit%204%20%E2%80%93%20representation/2017/02/03/bytes-file-sizes.html) research that you did.
