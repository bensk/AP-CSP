## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Targets
`AP` I can explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data.

## How big is this file?

I have a text file, `howbig.txt`.

It contains the text `How big is this file?`

So...how big is it?

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Code_Examples/Unicode" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:0px"></iframe>

Each ASCII character is 1 _byte_ of data.

So, what if I write `How big is this file?` in, say, Microsoft Word.

| File  | Size   |   
|---|---|---|
| `howbig.txt`  | 21 bytes  |   
|  `howbig.docx`  | 37000 bytes  |   

Almost 2000x bigger!
