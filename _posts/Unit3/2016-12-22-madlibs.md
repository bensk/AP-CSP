## 🎯 Learning Targets
- `AP` I can develop an abstraction when writing a program or creating other computational artifacts.
- `AP` I can use multiple levels of abstraction to write programs.
- `AP` I can identify multiple levels of abstractions that are used when writing programs.
- I can use a button to launch a user-defined function with multiple inputs in p5.

## Mad Libs Project
- At least 5 `inputs` for parts of speech
- MadLibs `button` that launches a **function** to create a new sentence.
- Code comments show evidence of iteration.
- Code comments reference previous approaches, and bugs.

###Create a paragraph

This works **JUST** like `createButton`:

```js
paragraph = createP("One day, I was walking to the " + p + " and I saw a " + a + " " + n);
paragraph.position(220, 0);
```

## 📌 Push Yourself
We haven't explored it in this class, but each of your p5 projects has a `style.css` file just waiting for you to make it look good.
