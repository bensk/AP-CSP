## Learning Targets
- I can define "algorithm" and give examples from daily life.
- I can define and write _pseudocode_.

## Activity 0: Creating Algorithms âœˆ
0âƒ£ Write an algorithm for making a paper
airplane.   
1âƒ£ Your partner must follow instructions exactly.

How can you use `if` and `else` in your instructions? What are `if...elseâ€¦` statements called?

When can you safely use `repeat` in your instructions? What is that called?

Were you instructions as clear as you thought? How did **ambiguity** get in your way?

## Activity 1: Minimum ðŸŽ´
This activity will help us compose more specific algorithms.

The AP CS Principles definition of **algorithm**:

<span style = "font-size: 30px; line-height: 1.2;">âœ¨Algorithms are precise sequences of instructions for processes that can be executed by a computer and are implemented using programming languages.âœ¨</span>

**Task:** Write an algorithm to find the card with the lowest value in the row of cards.

## Activity 2: ðŸ¤– Language Algorithms
Instead of writing our own commands, what happens if we agree on a set of simple commands?
