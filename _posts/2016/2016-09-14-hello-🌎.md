Try dragging the **Learning Target**.

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-preview-width="700">
var aim = "ðŸŽ¯ Learning Target: I can create a simple p5 sketch.";
var do_now = "Do Now: How many programming languages have you learned? Which is your favorite, and why?"

function setup() {
	createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);

}

function draw() {
	background('white');
	textSize(48);
	textFont("Proxima Nova");
	textStyle('bold');
	fill(`#7f1ae5`);
	if (mouseIsPressed) {
		text(aim, mouseX, mouseY, windowWidth);
		var do_now = "Uh oh...where'd the Do Now go?"
		textAlign('center')

	} else {
		text(aim, 10, 50, windowWidth);
		var do_now = "Do Now: How many programming languages have you learned? Which is your favorite, and why?"
	}
	textSize(18)
	textStyle('bold')
	fill('#424242')
	text(do_now, 10, 150, windowWidth, windowHeight)
}



function windowResized() {
	resizeCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

This is **<span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>**. It allows you to create interactive "sketches" using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.


> <small>p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for todayâ€™s web. Using the original metaphor of a software sketchbook, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, youâ€™re not limited to your drawing canvas, you can think of your whole browser page as your sketch! For this, p5.js has addon libraries that make it easy to interact with other HTML5 objects, including text, input, video, webcam, and sound.</small>


**<span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>** works on a `canvas`.

Everything you "draw" will be drawn on this canvas, `pixels` on a screen.

Here's one for you to play with:

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-preview-width="200">
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200,200);
}

function draw() {
  rect(50,50,80,50);
}

// What's this!?
</script>


## Exit Slip!

1. What happens if you change the numbers on line 6: `rect(50,50,80,50);`?
2. How could you draw a square?
3. What is the **algorithm** that p5 uses to draw rectangles?
3. How do you write a comment in <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>?
