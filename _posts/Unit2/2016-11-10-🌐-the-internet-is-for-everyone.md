So far everything we've done has been **two** people talking using **one** wire. The internet is a _bit_ bigger than that.

## Prompt

When you enter a web address in a browser and hit enter, what happens? At some point you see the web page in the browser, but what happens in between? What are all the steps?

Write down the series of things that you think (or have heard) happen right after you hit Enter. What happens first, second, third and so on. It's fine if you leave gaps, just write down everything you can think of.
