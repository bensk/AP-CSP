# Do Now
The letter `A` is represented by `65` in **ASCII**, the protocol used by most computers for text encoding.

> American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a set of digital codes representing letters, numerals, and other symbols, widely used as a standard format in the transfer of text between computers.

Deep inside your computer, that `65` is sent in binary. What is `65` in binary?

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Targets
I can use number bases, including binary, decimal, and hexadecimal,  to represent and investigate digital data.

I can explain why hexadecimal is used to represent digital data.

## Review decimal & binary


Let's write 15:

**Decimal:**   
In **decimal**, we have 10 symbols: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`.

15 in decimal:

| 1000 | 100 | 10 | 1 |
|------|-----|----|:---:|
|      |     |  1  | 5 |

**Binary**    
In **binary**, we have 2 symbols: `0, 1`

15 in binary:

| 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Binary numbers start to get very long, very quickly.

## Hexawhatnow?

> **Hexadecimal** - base 16

**Hexadecimal**
In **hexadecimal**, we have 16 symbols: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b ,c, d, e, f`

Wait, what?

15 in hexadecimal is `f`.

| 64 | 32 | 16 | 1 |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|  |  |  | f |

## Notice!
- How many `bits` does it take to write 15 in decimal, binary, and hexadecimal?
- Hex looks just like decimal...until we try to write **16**:

**Hexadecimal**

| 64 | 32 | 16 | 1 |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|  |  | 1 | 0 |

Where have we seen **hex** before?

> <span style = "color: #E32173">#E32173</span>

That's my favorite pink, <span style = "color: #E32173">Razzmatazz</span>. Colors can be represented by mixing red, green, and blue. How much RGB is  <span style = "color: #E32173">Razzmatazz</span>?

It's 227 red, 33 g, and 115 blue. How do I know that?

| <span style = "color: #E32173">Razzmatazz</span>  | R  | G  |  B |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Hex  | E3  | 21  | 73  |
| Decimal  | 227  | 33  | 115  |
