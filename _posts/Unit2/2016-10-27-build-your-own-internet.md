## Do Now (In Classroom)

What is your personal definition of ‚Äúinformation?‚Äù
What do you think "binary information" is?

## Develop a binary question
The question should have **two** answers. The response could be "yes/no," but it could also be choosing between two (or later, more) things.


## Develop a device
Using only materials in the room, you will build a device capable of transmitting a binary message across the room or around a corner.

**Rules**      
- No talking, no writing, no language.
- No throwing stuff
- Your device must work **at a distance**. You ~~might~~ will not be next to your partner.

üîÑ Swap devices with another group and learn their rules. Can you communicate with your partner?

## More Answers...
Let's go from `On` & `off` to **sequences** of `on` and `off`.

**(5 min)**
Can you invent new rules for your device to answer a question with **four** answers?

**(5min)**
Can you iterate and invent new rules for your device to answer a question with **eight** answers?

## Discussion
Could you use another group‚Äôs device to send your set of messages? Why or why not? What would you need to know from the other groups?

Based on what you‚Äôve seen in today‚Äôs activity what do you think are the limitations on the kinds of information we can send with binary messages?
