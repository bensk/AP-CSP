## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Targets

- I can research how computing innovations influence and are influenced by the economic, social, and cultural contexts in which they are designed and used.
- I can explain how computing enables innovation in nearly every field.

## Do Now
In Classroom, open the AP Explore Submission. What do you think is the difference (for the AP) between a **"Computational Artifact"** and a **"Computing Innovation"**.

## Explore Performance Task
> Computing innovations impact our lives in ways that require considerable study and reflection for us to fully understand them. In this performance task, you will explore a computing innovation of your choice. Your close examination of this computing innovation will deepen your understanding of computer science principles.
> Please note that once this performance task has been assigned as an assessment (rather than as practice), you are expected to complete the task with minimal assistance from anyone. For more clarification see the Guidelines for Completing the Through-Course Assessment section.
> You will be provided with 8 hours of class time to develop, complete, and submit the following:
> 1. A computational artifact
> 2. Written responses

### Computational Whatnow?
> Your creation could solve a problem, show creative expression, or provide the viewer with new insight or knowledge.


### Effective artifacts include:
- Visual, graphical, and/or audio content to help a reader understand the purpose of a computing innovation; and
- The use of communications media, such as animations, comic strips, **infographics**, and/or public service announcements, to illustrate the purpose of a computing innovation.

### Practice Explore Task
We are going to finish our internet unit by doing a practice Explore Task. I will be giving you four hours (instead of 8) and limiting your innovations to those relating to the internet.

For today, we're going to try out _one_ of the effective artifact suggestions: the **[infographic](https://magic.piktochart.com/templates)**.

You will be creating an infographic to depict the layers of abstraction that make the internet possible, and explaining how we simulated each in class.

An ugly, incomplete version would include this:
