## Learning Targets
I can explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data.
I can convert between binary and decimal.

## Count to 3...
We are used to counting in **decimal** because we have 10 fingers. We work with **place values** that go up in powers of 10:

| 1000 | 100 | 10 | 1 |
|------|-----|----|---|
|      |     |    | 3 |

## Count to 11...

| 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
