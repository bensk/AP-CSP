## Learning Targets
I can explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data.
I can convert between binary and decimal.

## Count to 3...
We are used to counting in **decimal** because we have 10 fingers. We work with _place values_ that go up in **powers of 10**:

| 1000 | 100 | 10 | 1 |
|------|-----|----|:---:|
|      |     |    | 3 |

## Count to 11...
Binary works the same way, but the _place values_ go up in **powers of 2**:

| 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
