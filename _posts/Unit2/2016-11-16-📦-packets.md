## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Targets

- I can develop a packet-switching protocol.
- I can explain how the internet is a packet-switched system.
- I can explain the importance of standards for packets and routing include transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP).

## Do Now

## Routing

A **router** is a computer designed to receive and redirect packets of information based upon the  IP address contained in the packet.

Routers will either deliver a packet to its final destination or forward it to one of several other routers it is connected to.

[Let's trace this route](http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/visual-tracert/).

## Packets
`TCP` Transfer Control...guess!

I'll let Vint and Lynn explain:

## Packet Switch Relay
We're going to do a simplified packet-switching system. We have packets of information that need to travel across our "network" â€“ this classroom.

## Assess!
