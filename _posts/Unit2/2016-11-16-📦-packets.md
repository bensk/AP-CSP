## 🎯 Learning Targets

- I can develop a packet-switching protocol.
- I can explain how the internet is a packet-switched system.
- I can explain the importance of standards for packets and routing include transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP).

### <div style = 'text-align: center'>🐮 </div>

When we began this unit, we simulated the internet at a high level of **abstraction**, [sending simple messages back and forth](http://bsk.education/AP-CSP/unit%202%20%E2%80%93%20the%20internet/2016/10/27/build-your-own-internet.html).

### <div style = 'text-align: center'>`01000010 01110101 01101100 01101100 `</div>

Then we went down another level of abstraction to expressing those messages [using binary](http://bsk.education/AP-CSP/unit%202%20%E2%80%93%20the%20internet/2016/11/01/binary.html).

Then, we went 🆙 a level of abstraction to express those messages [using hex](http://bsk.education/AP-CSP/unit%202%20%E2%80%93%20the%20internet/2016/11/07/textencoding.html).

Last time, we talked about how all of these abstractions are flawed, because they only depict 1:1 communication. Then we [played Battleship](http://bsk.education/AP-CSP/unit%202%20%E2%80%93%20the%20internet/2016/11/14/ip-addresses.html) and you developed your own protocol for simultaneous communication using bits.

Guess what?

Even the IP is a level of abstraction for what actually happens...

## Routing
A **router** is a computer designed to receive and redirect packets of information based upon the  IP address contained in the packet.

Routers will either deliver a packet to its final destination or forward it to one of several other routers it is connected to.

[Let's trace this route](http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/visual-tracert/).

## Packet Switch Relay Race
We're going to do a simplified packet-switching system. We have packets of information that need to travel across our "network" – this classroom.

Seven of you will be requesting data from the internet. The rest of you will be routers. Your router name is your initials, in ASCII. Mine would be:

`42 53 4b`

You can use the Unicode Converter to find yours:

As we switch packets, be sure to write your router ID on the ~packet~ envelope.

## Packets
`TCP` Transfer Control...guess!

I'll let Vint and Lynn explain:

Last time, we developed a protocol that included:

- Sender
- Receiver
- Message
- Success/failure

## Assess!
Explain how `IP/TCP` and `DNS` are an example of **abstraction**.
