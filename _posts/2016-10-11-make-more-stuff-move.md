## Do Now (In Google Classroom)
What does it mean to **initialize** a variable? Why do we need to do that when programming?
What does it mean to **increment** a variable? What does it let us do?
Why should we pick meaningful names for variables in our code?

## From the AP:
> Program instructions may involve variables that are initialized and updated, read, and written    
> Meaningful names for variables and procedures help people better understand programs.
