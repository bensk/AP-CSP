## Course Overview

## Texts

## Programming Language
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

> p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for todayâ€™s web.

> Using the original metaphor of a software sketchbook, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, youâ€™re not limited to your drawing canvas, you can think of your whole browser page as your sketch! For this, p5.js has addon libraries that make it easy to interact with other HTML5 objects, including text, input, video, webcam, and sound.

## Teaching Strategies

## Assessment
- Every week or so, students will be assessed using multiple choice questions drawn from AP CSP exams, or adapted from AP CSP exams.

## Example Activities

### P1: Connecting Computing
- In Unit TK, Internet Security, students learn about common security attacks (bug exploits, viruses, phishing, and DDoS attacks) and learn about security measures that they can take to mitigate their own risk. `LO 6.3.1 [P1]`
- In Unit TK, Innovating for Social Change, students research and analyze the contextual suitability and effects of a computing innovation. `LO 1.2.5 [P4], LO 7.1.1 [P4], LO 7.3.1 [P4], LO 7.4.1 [P1], LO 7.5.1 [P1], LO 7.5.2 [P5]`

### P2: Creating Computational Artifacts
- In **Unit 1: Algorithms & Programming**, students collaborate to develop a program in p5.js to create a simple drawing application. `LO 4.1.1 [P2], LO 4.1.2 [P5], LO 5.1.3 [P6]`
- In **Unit 2: Building Apps**, students use an iterative and exploratory development process and multiple levels of abstraction as they create scripts to draw a single tile, a row, and a grid for a game board. `LO 1.1.1 [P2], LO 2.2.2 [P3]`

### P3: Abstracting
- In  **Unit 1: Algorithms & Programming**, students analyze how several programs implement algorithms, e.g. discussing how a short algorithm with a loop generates the image of a square; comparing and contrasting various square-drawing algorithms; and predicting what an algorithm does. Students iterate on these algorithms to create programs to draw different shapes based on user input in **Unit 2: Building Apps**. `LO 5.2.1 [P3]`
- In **Unit 3: Digital Information**, students import data from texts and display the data visually to draw insights and represent information. `LO 2.3.1 [P3], LO 2.3.2 [P3]`

### P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts

### P5: Communicating

### P6: Collaborating
